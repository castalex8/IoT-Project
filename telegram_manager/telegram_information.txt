----------------How to show options in telegram bot----------------
For that, you have to talk to BotFather.

In the Telegram App, open the chat with BotFather.

Send him /setcommands. He will present you with a list of your bots.

Pick the bot for which you want to set the command menu.

Compose and send the command list. Using your image as an example, these 4 lines should do:

start - Description 1
menu - Description 2
help - Description 3
stop - Description 4

Note that each line should start with lowercase, and no slashes. There should also be spaces around the - sign.

Once you complete this process, exit and kill the Telegram App. Re-open it, go to the chat with your target bot,
type a / (or tab on the / button next to the text field), the command menu should come up.

we use:
start - welcome message
help - help message
show_data - show all the user data
set_data - set all the user data
find_book - find a book with specific title
reserve_book - reserve a book with specific title
freespace - check if the available bridge is free
sign_in - sign_in user to available bridge
qr_code - show your qr_code
